Motivation to create Team Manager?
-------------------------------
I was using JIRA for task/project management but it is paid and has so many features that I dont need.
I was looking for a compact minimalist team management system, so I created this one for myself and for my small team.
Would anticipate that this open source project would be useful to anyone who has same need !
